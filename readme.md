# People API for CCA Portal

Use the "people" Elasticsearch endpoint as a public API from Portal. The Instructional Support team has a need to pull accurate lists of program administrators (faculty chairs & co-chairs, staff program managers & senior managers) complete with contact information. Portal has this data and exposes it in a machine-readable format.
